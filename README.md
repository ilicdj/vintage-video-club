Project Introduction
As someone who enjoys a good movie and loves the concept that not so long time ago one had to rent a movie to be able to watch it,
I came up with an idea to make a web application for users to make the reservation for movie in video club. If this was a real website 20 years ago,
it would be helpful for users to make sure their favorite movie would be available for them when they come up in the store to pick it up.

Project Description
Application allows user to register new account and login to the system, then user can choose listed movies and add them to their wish list and 
from there, user can make a reservation for selected movies.
Implemented registration and login system using object oriented PHP and MySQL database management system. For front-end I used Sass to style my 
HTML elements and also animation library GSAP along side BarbaJS to make sure page transitions were more creative.
In near future I hope I will make advanced version of this project using more modern solutions as Laravel PHP framework and CSS framework TailWind, that would be next goal.
